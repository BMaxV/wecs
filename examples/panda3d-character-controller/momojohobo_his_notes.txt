# NoClipFreeFloatCharacter (spectator mode)
#   -Forward/Backward-
#     Move in direction camera is at float_speed.
#   -Left/Right-
#       Strafe node left and right relative to camera at float_strafe.
# FirstPersonInput


# Jump
# Crouch
# Flying
# Swimming
# Walking
#   -Mouse movement-
#     FP: Rotate camera up and down, rotate node left and right.
#     TP: Circle around node.
#   -Forward/Backward-:
#     Add/sub walk_accel to fwd_momentum untill walk_speed_max.
#     Affects node in the direction of camera's Z-rotation
#   -Left/Right-
#     Add/sub walk_strafe_accel to strafe_momentum untill walk_strafe_max.
#     Strafe left and right relative to camera's Z-rotation.
#   -Crouch-
#     Enters Crouching mode.
#     A bool should determine wether it should be held or if it's toggled.
#   -Sprint- with a stamina > 0
#     Enters Sprinting mode.
#   Fire ray ray from heels to floor:
#     If not hit around soles:
#       add gravity to fall_speed
#   Else, touching the ground:
#     ground_friction is added/subtracted from *_momentum.
#     succesive_walljumps = 0
#     fall_speed = 0
#   If ground is sloped beyond a certain threshold, the body is pushed down the slope.
# 
# Crouching
#   Same as walking, but the physics-body is scaled along Z and camera lowered so they don't exceed crouch_height.
#   walk_speed_max is temporarely set to crouch_speed.
# 
# Sprinting
#   Same as walking, but faster.
#   Add/sub run_speed_acceleration from fwd_momentum logarithmically untill run_speed_maximum.
#   Drains stamina by stamina_drain_sprint.
#   If colliding with a shape below vault_height_max, trigger context vault
# 
# Jump
#   Setting fall_speed to a negative value makes character jump.
#   Up to jump_height_max, the longer jump is held the higher one jumps.
#   fwd_momentum gets a small boost, jump_speed_accel.
#   Take bite out of stamina, stamina_jump_drain.
#   -Forward/Backward-
#     Add/sub aircontrol to fwd_momentum.
#   -Left/Right-
#     Add/sub aircontrol to strafe_momentum.
#   -Crouch-
#     TODO: Move legs up to make yourself smaller?
#   Fire 2 rays, one from from the scalp, one from the chin, towards the node's Z-rotation
#     Enable climb context on collision with only the lower one.
# 
# 
# Powerslide
#   When foward, crouch and sprint are held after landing, and with high enough fwd_momentum, you enter powerslide mode.
#   Ground_friction is set to a lower value, slide_friction, resulting in a sliding motion.
#   When momentum is below crouch_speed it switches back to regular crouching mode.
#   Stamina is drained stamina_drain_powerslide, higher then vanilla drain.
#   Strafe speed is halved.
# 
# Wallrunning
#   When
#       fall_speed is outside some threshold
#       fwd_momentum is above some threshold
#       is colliding with wall to a side
#       wall is sloped in some threshold (70-90 degrees?)
#   you continue sprinting, and fall speed becomes (close to) zero
#   Stamina is drained by stamina_drain_wallrunning, higher then vanilla drain
#   fwd_momentum is drained by some amount
#   Either triggered automatically or with -action-
# 
# Walljumping
#   When
#       fall_speed is outside some threshold
#       is colliding with wall
#       wall is sloped in some threshold (70-90 degrees?)
#       this is not your Xth walljump
# 
#   You're allowed to Jump and *_momentum is mirrored from wall normal
# 
# Context Modes
#   Some things are context sensitive, like vaulting over a chest-high wall or sitting on a chair.
#   Usually triggered with -action-
#   Ignore all input
#   Play some character animation, possibly with a loop,
#   Run some custom function
#   Set new loc/rot when done?
